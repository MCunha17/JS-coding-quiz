# JavaScript Coding Quiz
## Description

This is a timed JavaScript coding quiz, consisting of 10 multiple-choice questions, designed to allow developers to practice taking coding assessments, which they may face as part of a job interview process. Once the user starts the quiz, they will have 75 seconds to answer each question. However, for every incorrect answer, the quiz taker's remaining time will be reduced by 10 seconds. Once the quiz is complete, quiz takers can enter their initials to submit their score and have it displayed on the leaderboard.

Coding assessments are often used by employers to evaluate candidates for developer positions. By practicing for these assessments, developers can improve their chances of doing well during the actual assessment and ultimately, increase their chances of being hired for the job.
